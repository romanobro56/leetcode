Hello. This is the first note that I am leaving on the repo
This is to note my findings of each leetcode problem and hopefully:
  1. refresh and summarize what I have learned in each problem
  2. leave something behind so that if the topic comes up again, I have some mental breadcrumbs
# 3Sum Notes
the theory side will not always be the hardest part of the problem
- this problem had lots of loop 'manipulation' and indexing that made it difficult to solve even while I knew how to solve it.

READ THROUGH THE DAMN PROBLEM AND UNDERSTAND IT TO THE FULLEST BEFORE STARTING

Complex problems are comprised of simpler problems
- try to break up an unknown problem into smaller, simpler problems mentally

python array.sort() is nlogn 

usually name the return object 'res'

python accessing the last element in the array is index [-1]

Imma need a new way to work through problems visually or iteratively because it did not go so well this time
- want to show the interviewer critical thinking skills and while slamming your head into the wall repeatedly works when coding regularly, it looks pretty bad in live action.
- even if you work through a problem well the first time there is a good chance that you are going to run into something unexpected. Not something that no one could expect, something that you didn't expect. And the only good way to recover is use critical problem solving skills to work through the problem in the most efficient manner you can.

later on: control f python in this document and create notecard based upon the python knowledge I pick up.
