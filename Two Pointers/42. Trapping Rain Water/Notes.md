This one was kinda a doozy. I tried by first implementing my O(n^2) which was a bad idea\
I thought that the amortized time complexity would make up for it but remember they manufacture the test cases to punish such practice. I would say that's a good thing because I could have saved a lot of time if I just stopped at creating the first solution\

two pointers. (l<r) never fails

Overall reading through the problem thoroughly helped but it was a hard problem so I still couldn't pull through

Navdeep's thought process was really insightful. Initially he had used logic to create a solution that was O(n) time which was already good enough to wow an interviewer\ 
he then improved upon the memory complexity by adding an additional "layer of logic" on top of his first solution which used the same concept with a better implementation. If you saw the second solution initially, you probably wouldn't understand it much at all. But the fact that he took a good solution and made it better was really cool. 

thinking in terms of multiple sources of data can help
