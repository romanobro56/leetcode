Not all mediums are difficult

a regular pattern in two pointers is a simple check to see if the pointers passed eachother ex. while(l>r)

There should be a methodical reading and interpreting to the leetcode questions just like on the SAT
- for example, I was trying to do too much logic until I realized that all you have to do is return the maximum. 
because I assumed you had to return the indecies of the maximum area lines, not only would that have looked bad
to the interviewer that I didn't read the question thoroughly, even if I could recover by being smart 
it would have wasted a whole bunch of time on the interview and barely give me enough time 
to show the interviewer my skills

keep it simple
