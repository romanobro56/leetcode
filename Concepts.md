1. Hash vs Array - Arrays have index, hash has key. Arrays are ordered, 0 - n and one item can be stored per index. You can push and pop items from the array. Hashes have keys, which are linked to their paired value. There can be multiple values per key. Keys can be of any object type, such as string or int or float. You can do things such as search for the values held by a key or delete all the items held by a key.
2. Hash Map - The hash function takes a key and computes an index (also known as a hash code), which determines where the key-value pair will be stored in the hash map. The efficiency of a hash map largely depends on the quality of its hash function.
